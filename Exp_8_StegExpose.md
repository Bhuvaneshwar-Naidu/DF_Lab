# **Ex.No.8: Use StegExpose to Detect Hidden Data in Images**

---

## **Aim**
To detect the presence of hidden data within digital images using **StegExpose**, a steganalysis tool that evaluates image statistics to identify steganographic content.

---

## **Step-by-Step Procedure**

### **Step1️: Download and Set Up for Steganography**
1. Visit the **StegExpose GitHub page** and download the `.jar` file.  
2. Ensure **Java** is installed on your system. If not, download it from [Oracle’s official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).  
3. Place the `StegExpose.jar` file in your working directory (e.g., `C:\DF\StegExpose\`).
4. Or you can run it online, using any Steganography tools available online.

### **Step3️: Compare and Save the Stegno Image**
1. Compare the difference between the normal and the stegnoimage.
2. Right click the image and click on save image.
3. Name the file as **Stegno image** and click on save.
