- **Google USB Driver (Windows):** For PC-device connectivity

### ü™ú **Instructions**
1. Create the main lab directory:
   ```bash
   C:\DF
   ```
2. Extract all downloaded ZIP archives into this folder:
   ```bash
   C:\DF\platform-tools\
   C:\DF\aflogical-ose\
   C:\DF\usb-driver\
   ```
3. **Note:**  
   If `AFLogical-OSE.apk` is missing, use **Santoku Linux** or another forensic OS to build or extract it from the source.

##  **STEP 2 ‚Äî Configure System Environment (PATH)**

### **Purpose**
To make `adb` commands accessible from any terminal or command prompt without specifying the full path.

###  **Steps**
1. Open:  
   **Control Panel ‚Üí System ‚Üí Advanced system settings ‚Üí Environment Variables**
2. Under *User Variables*, select **Path ‚Üí Edit ‚Üí New**.
3. Add:
   ```bash
   C:\DF\platform-tools
   ```
4. Click **OK** to apply.

###  **Verification**
Run:
```bash
adb version
```
**Expected Output:**  
Displays the installed **Android Debug Bridge version**.

---

## **STEP 3 ‚Äî Install Google USB Driver (Windows Specific)**

###  **Purpose**
To ensure the Windows system can identify and communicate with the connected Android device.

###  **Steps**
1. Connect the Android phone via USB.  
2. Open **Device Manager** ‚Üí Locate your phone.  
3. Right-click ‚Üí **Update Driver** ‚Üí **Browse my computer for drivers**.  
4. Specify path:
   ```bash
   C:\DF\usb-driver
   ```
5. Click **Next** to complete installation.

###  **Verification**
Run:
```bash
adb devices
```
Device should be listed as **‚Äúdevice‚Äù**, not *offline* or *unauthorized*.

---

## **STEP 4 ‚Äî Prepare the Android Device (Developer Options)**

###  **Steps**
1. Go to **Settings ‚Üí About Phone ‚Üí Tap ‚ÄúBuild Number‚Äù 7 times**.  
2. Return to **Settings ‚Üí Developer Options**.  
3. Enable:
   - USB Debugging  
   - Install via USB (if available)

---

##  **STEP 5 ‚Äî Establish and Verify ADB Connection**

###  **Purpose**
To confirm a stable and authorized link between your computer and the Android device.

###  **Steps**
1. Connect your phone via USB.  
2. Run:
   ```bash
   adb devices
   ```
3. Tap **Allow** on the phone if prompted for debugging authorization.

###  **Troubleshooting**
If the device shows as *unauthorized*, replug it and reauthorize USB debugging.

---

##  **STEP 6 ‚Äî Deploy AFLogical OSE to the Device**

###  **Purpose**
To install the AFLogical forensic application on the Android device.

###  **Steps**
1. Confirm APK location:
   ```bash
   C:\DF\aflogical-ose\AFLogical-OSE.apk
   ```
2. Install using ADB:
   ```bash
   adb install --bypass-low-target-sdk-block "C:\Users\Manya\Downloads\DF\ForensicLab\AFLogical-OSE_1.5.2.apk"
   ```

---

##  **STEP 7 ‚Äî Execute Logical Data Extraction**

###  **Purpose**
To perform the actual data extraction from the Android device using AFLogical.

###  **Steps**
1. Open **AFLogical** on the Android device.  
2. Grant all necessary permissions (Contacts, SMS, Call Logs, Storage).  
3. Select the data types to extract:
   - üìá Contacts  
   - üí¨ SMS  
   - üìû Call Logs  
   - üì® MMS  
   - üìÖ Calendar  
4. Tap **Start Extraction**.  
5. Wait for extraction to finish.

###  **Default Save Location**
```bash
/sdcard/aflogical/
```
or
```bash
/storage/emulated/0/aflogical/
```

---

##  **STEP 8 ‚Äî Collect Extracted Data (Pull to PC)**

###  **Purpose**
To transfer the extracted `.csv` data from the Android device to your computer.

###  **Command**
```bash
adb pull /sdcard/aflogical C:\Users\Manya\Downloads
```

###  **Verification**
Extracted files will be saved in:
```bash
C:\Users\Manya\Downloads
```
The folder should contain files like:
- `contacts.csv`
- `sms.csv`
- `calllogs.csv`
- `calendar.csv`


---

## üßæ **Result**
Successfully extracted logical data (Contacts, SMS, Call Logs, etc.) from an Android device using **AFLogical OSE**, transferred it to the computer using ADB, and analyzed the extracted `.csv` files for forensic investigation.

---

## üß† **Notes**
- AFLogical OSE performs **logical extraction only** ‚Äî it cannot retrieve deleted files.  
- Ensure the device screen is **unlocked** during extraction.  
- **Root access is not required**, making this suitable for standard forensic practices.  
- Maintain **chain of custody** documentation for forensic integrity.
