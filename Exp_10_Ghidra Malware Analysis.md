# Ex No-10: Use Ghidra to Disassemble and Analyze Malware Code

---

## Aim
To disassemble and analyze a binary using **Ghidra** to identify potential malicious behavior and understand code functionality.

---

## Description
Ghidra is a free reverse-engineering framework that helps analysts disassemble and decompile binaries to inspect assembly and pseudocode. This experiment covers loading a binary, running auto-analysis, locating key functions and strings, and deriving behavioral indicators.

---

## Steps
1. **Prepare Environment**
   - Use an isolated VM (VirtualBox/VMware) with a snapshot.
   - Install Ghidra and required dependencies.

---

2. **Load Binary**
   - Open Ghidra and create a new project.
   - Import the target binary into the project.

---

3. **Run Auto-Analysis**
   - Allow Ghidra to perform auto-analysis with default options.
   - Review the analysis log for any warnings.

---

4. **String and Import Inspection**
   - Search for suspicious strings (URLs, file paths, commands).
   - Check imported functions for networking, file, or process APIs.

---

5. **Function Analysis**
   - Identify interesting functions via cross-references (xrefs).
   - Use the Decompiler to read C-like pseudocode and annotate logic.
   - Rename functions and variables for clarity.
