# Ex No-10: Use Ghidra to Disassemble and Analyze Malware Code

---

## üéØ Aim
To disassemble and analyze a binary using **Ghidra** to identify potential malicious behavior and understand code functionality.

---

## üìå Description
Ghidra is a free reverse-engineering framework that helps analysts disassemble and decompile binaries to inspect assembly and pseudocode. This experiment covers loading a binary, running auto-analysis, locating key functions and strings, and deriving behavioral indicators.

---

## üìù Steps
1. **Prepare Environment**
   - Use an isolated VM (VirtualBox/VMware) with a snapshot.
   - Install Ghidra and required dependencies.

2. **Load Binary**
   - Open Ghidra and create a new project.
   - Import the target binary into the project.

3. **Run Auto-Analysis**
   - Allow Ghidra to perform auto-analysis with default options.
   - Review the analysis log for any warnings.

4. **Initial Reconnaissance**
   - Browse the **Symbol Tree** and **Functions** list.
   - Open the **Listing** and **Decompiler** windows for the entry point.

5. **String and Import Inspection**
   - Search for suspicious strings (URLs, file paths, commands).
   - Check imported functions for networking, file, or process APIs.

6. **Function Analysis**
   - Identify interesting functions via cross-references (xrefs).
   - Use the Decompiler to read C-like pseudocode and annotate logic.
   - Rename functions and variables for clarity.

7. **Control Flow & Data Flow**
   - Generate function graphs to visualize control flow.
   - Trace data flow for suspicious API calls (e.g., socket, CreateRemoteThread).

8. **Scripting & Automation (Optional)**
   - Use Ghidra Python/Jython scripts to extract strings, label functions, or generate reports.

9. **Document Findings**
   - Record IOC's (hashes, strings, domains), key functions, and behavioral summary.

---

## ‚úÖ Result
Loaded the binary into Ghidra, performed static analysis to identify key functions and strings, and produced a summarized report of observed behaviors and indicators of compromise (IoCs).
