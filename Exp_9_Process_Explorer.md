## **STEP 2 ‚Äî Familiarize Yourself with the Interface**

### **Key Components**
- **Process Tree:** Displays hierarchical structure of running processes.  
- **Color Codes:**
  - Pink ‚Üí Suspended processes  
  - Light Blue ‚Üí Processes under the current user  
  - Dark Blue ‚Üí System or service processes  
  - Green ‚Üí Newly created processes  
  - Red ‚Üí Recently exited processes  

### **Columns Overview**
- **PID:** Process ID number  
- **CPU Usage:** Real-time processor consumption  
- **Memory Usage:** RAM utilization  
- **Description & Company Name:** Metadata for legitimacy verification  

---

## **STEP 3 ‚Äî Identify Suspicious Processes**

### **1Ô∏è Look for Unfamiliar Processes**
- Review all running processes and identify unknown or oddly named ones.
- Malware often disguises itself using similar names to legitimate processes.

### **2Ô∏è Verify Digital Signatures**
- Right-click a process ‚Üí **Properties ‚Üí Image Tab ‚Üí Verify**.  
- Check for a valid **Digital Signature**.  
  -  Valid Signature ‚Üí Legitimate software  
  -  No/Invalid Signature ‚Üí Potentially malicious

### **3Ô∏è Check Process Path**
- In the **Properties ‚Üí Image Tab**, review the file path.  
  - Legitimate processes reside in:  
    ```bash
    C:\Windows\System32
    ```  
  - Suspicious if running from:  
    - Temporary folders  
    - User download folders  
    - Unknown directories

### **4Ô∏è Monitor Resource Usage**
- Observe CPU, Memory, and Disk columns.  
- Abnormally high or fluctuating usage could signal malware.

### **5Ô∏è Review Description & Company Name**
- Missing or misleading information may indicate fake or rogue software.

### **6Ô∏è Check Network Activity**
- Right-click process ‚Üí **Properties ‚Üí TCP/IP Tab**.  
- Monitor for unexpected network connections to unknown IPs.

---

## **STEP 4 ‚Äî Perform Online Verification**

### **Actions**
- Perform a quick Google search using the suspicious process name (e.g., `randomname.exe`).  
- Cross-check the process in malware databases like:  
  - [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/)  
  - [ProcessLibrary](https://www.processlibrary.com/)  

---

## **STEP 5 ‚Äî Take Action on Suspicious Processes**

### **Options**
- **Kill Process:**  
  Terminate the process immediately:  
  `Right-click ‚Üí Kill Process`  

- **Suspend Process:**  
  Temporarily pause activity for further analysis:  
  `Right-click ‚Üí Suspend`  

- **Delete Source File:**  
  Locate the file via **Path** and delete it if confirmed malicious.

>  *Note:* Some malware prevents termination. In such cases, reboot into **Safe Mode** or use antivirus tools.

---

## **STEP 6 ‚Äî System Cleanup and Scan**

### **Recommendations**
- Perform a full antivirus scan using tools like:
  - Windows Defender
  - Malwarebytes Anti-Malware
- Remove quarantined threats and restart the system.

##  **Example ‚Äî Identifying a Malicious Process**

### **Action Taken**
- Suspended ‚Üí Killed the process  
- Removed file from directory  
- Performed full malware scan  

**Result:** Confirmed as malicious software and successfully removed.
