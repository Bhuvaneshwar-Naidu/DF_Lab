- Select the data types you want to extract.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Start Data Extraction
- After selecting the data categories, the app begins extraction.  
- Extracted data will be stored in **CSV format** under the `/sdcard/aflogical/` directory.

---

## üíæ Step 4: Transfer Extracted Data to Your Computer

Use **ADB pull** to copy the extracted data from the device to your PC:

```bash
adb pull /sdcard/aflogical /path/to/destination
```

üîπ Replace `/path/to/destination` with your preferred folder path on your computer.

**Example:**
```bash
adb pull /sdcard/aflogical C:\Users\Manya\Downloads\ExtractedData
```

Verify the transfer by checking that the `.csv` files (e.g., `contacts.csv`, `sms.csv`, `calllogs.csv`) are present in the destination directory.

---

## üìä Step 5: Analyze the Extracted Data

### Open and Review Data
- Use **Excel**, **Google Sheets**, or any **CSV viewer** to open and analyze the files.  
- Each file represents a category of extracted information:
  - `contacts.csv` ‚Üí Contact list  
  - `sms.csv` ‚Üí Text messages  
  - `calllogs.csv` ‚Üí Call history  

### Document Your Findings
- Review relevant data for forensic insights.  
- Summarize findings in a **forensic report** for documentation and evidence handling.

## üßπ Step 6: Clean Up

### Uninstall AFLogical OSE
After completing extraction, uninstall the app from the device:

```bash
adb uninstall com.viaforensics.android.aflogical
```

### Safely Disconnect the Device
- Once data extraction and transfer are complete, safely disconnect the Android device from your computer.
